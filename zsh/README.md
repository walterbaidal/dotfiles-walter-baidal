# ZSH

This folder contains your config scripts for your terminal.

You can create for example a file with your custom aliases adding a file named ```my-aliases.zsh``` or a file named ```env.zsh``` with your environment variables.

Also you can have a ```install.sh``` script for example to create your workspace folder.
